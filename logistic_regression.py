def logistic_regression(x_train: np.ndarray, y_train: np.ndarray, x_test: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    '''
    Implements the logistic regression algorithm.

    Parameters:
        - x_train: Training features of shape (n_samples, 2).
                    For this assignment, each training sample has two features: [feature1, feature2]
        - y_train: Training labels (0/1)
                    All the predictions will be binary (0 or 1), since it is Logistic Regression.
        - x_test: Test features of shape (n_samples, 2).

    Returns:
        y_pred: Predicted labels for the test set
